File "0a.libraries and alignment function" contains all libraries we used for ALL algorithms 
and an alignment function used for "1.a Dynamic Programming", "2.a Divide and Conquer version 1", 
"2.b Divide and Conquer version 2", "4b. Branch and Bound version 2", and "5. Stripe K".

Files : "3.Pure recursive" and "4a.Branch and Bound version 1" use their own alignment function.

Be attention: For greedy algorithms we didn't make any alignment function!

File "0b.test" will give you some ideas how to test the algorithms.

file "7. KMEAN cluster protein data" contains all codes to extract data and cluster it.
the code is based on K-Means strategy but already modified for the case of non-euclidean features.
