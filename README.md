# The Edit Distance Problem - Advanced Algorithm Project

## Description
The objective of this project is to implement some algorithms for computing the Edit distance (ED) (an adaptation of the LCS problem) and to provide an experimental study of their running time and the quality of the solution given.

## Tasks
Program different algorithms for the ED problem, including:

- A classic algorithm based on dynamic programming
- A version combining dynamic programming and divide and conquer approaches
- A pure recursive version
- A branch-and-bound version of the recursive approach
- An approximated version of the classical dynamic programming approach where one fills only a stripe of
size k around the diagonal of the matrix
- An approximated version based on a greedy approach
